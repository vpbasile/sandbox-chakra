' New Feature: Platform Tracking

I want to add the ability to track which platforms I have purchaased a given book on (e.g., Kindle, Audible, Paperback, etc.). This will help me avoid duplicate purchases and better manage my reading resources.

To implement this feature, I will need to update the data model to include a list of platforms for each book. I will also need to modify the UI to allow users to select and view the platforms associated with each book. Additionally, I will create functions to add or remove platforms from a book's record.

I also want to create a function that updates the books file with the new platform information whenever a book is added or modified.
